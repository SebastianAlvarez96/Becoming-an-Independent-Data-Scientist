Final Assignment¶

For last assignment of the course, I decided to work on air pollution in my city, focusing on an especially dangerous and pervasive type of pollution: particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter, PM10, and PM2.5 (https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics#PM )

I wanted to check if levels of particulate matter near my home exceeded the limit recommended by the World Health Organization, and how the levels of pollution in my city compares with those in a similar area in New York city.

This data is an hourly report of the last six months of particulate matter monitored at the station closest to my home. The report was generated with these parameters:
